## Quantification and Estimation of Antimicrobial Resistance Genes from Shotgun Metagenomic Sequence Data
This repository encapsulates a computational schema that can be utilized to estimate both absolute and relative abundances of Antimicrobial Resistance Genes (ARG's) using sequence data from livestock metagenomes. 

### Methodology
#### 1.  Quality Control + Pre-Processing
#### 2.  Antibotic Resistant Gene Mapping
#### 3.  16s rRNA Gene Mapping
Necessary for metagenome taxonomical quantification.
#### 4.  Gene Quantification
#### 5.  Sample Normalization
#### 6.  Metadata Association
